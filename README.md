This repository contains the eclipse project to create a Java GUI which connects to your MongoDB database

## Requirements
- Eclipse IDE
- MongoDB Database
- Maven (for dependencies)

## Important to note
- You will have to replace the connection strings and other Strings in /mongoConnection.java
- Make sure the project is configured to build in maven and the pom file is properly updated


Any updates and improvements to the project would be appreciated :smile:
